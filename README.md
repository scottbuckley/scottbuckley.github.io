## Scott Buckley

I am, among other things, a computer scientist.

Currently I am living in Sydney and being a full-time dad to my little boy Boon. I have also been doing my own research into smart contract auditing and blockchain verification, which is a field in which I'd like to continue working, in the future.

I like writing programs, writing proofs, solving puzzles, tasting fermented things, woodworking, traveling, 3D printing, and lots of other things.

## Other stuff hosted here
This is just the landing page for my Github Pages [repo](https://github.com/scottbuckley/scottbuckley.github.io), which contains the following sub-repos:
- My [mead calculator](/mead/), which estimates residual sugars and Delle tolerances, as well as allowing to back-calculate original or final gravities, given a target FG or ABV. Of the three primary input fields, select the radio button next to the field you want to solve for.
- [Sudoku](/Sudoku/), a mostly feature-complete interactive sudoku solver, which you can ask to solve your sudoku, or you can use as an interface to solve sudoku variants. It has lots of undocumented features, but the buttons along the bottom roughly tell you what you can do.
- [Slitherlink](/Slitherlink/), [Slitherlink Square](/Slitherlink%20Sq/), [Star Battle](/StarBattle/), and [Masyu](/Masyu/), which will beautifully solve these various puzzle types before your very eyes, but will only allow you to change the input puzzle if you modify the JavaScript source. These are non-interactive. All of the solutions are *constructive*, meaning my code never guesses or back-tracks.
