## Scott Buckley

I am, among other things, a computer scientist.

Currently I live and work in Sydney, Australia, at [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/).

I like writing programs, writing proofs, solving puzzles, tasting fermented things, woodworking, traveling, 3D printing, and lots of other things.

## Other stuff hosted here
This is just the landing page for my Github Pages [repo](https://github.com/scottbuckley/scottbuckley.github.io), which contains the following sub-repos:
- My [mead calculator](/mead/), which estimates residual sugars and Delle tolerances, as well as allowing to back-calculate original or final gravities, given a target FG or ABV. Of the three primary input fields, select the radio button next to the field you want to solve for.
- [Sudoku](/Sudoku/), a mostly feature-complete interactive sudoku solver, which you can ask to solve your sudoku, or you can use as an interface to solve sudoku variants. It has lots of undocumented features, but the buttons along the bottom roughly tell you what you can do.
- [Grid](/Grid/), a new in-progress evolution of the sudoku solver, which aims to allow for more kinds of sudoku-like puzzles, but is not restricted to 9x9 grids, and is also mobile friendly.
- [Slitherlink](/Slitherlink/), [Slitherlink Square](/Slitherlink%20Sq/), [Star Battle](/StarBattle/), and [Masyu](/Masyu/), which will beautifully solve these various puzzle types before your very eyes, but will only allow you to change the input puzzle if you modify the JavaScript source. These are non-interactive. All of the solutions are *constructive*, meaning my code never guesses or back-tracks.
